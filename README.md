# Smartwatch-analyzing
Executed a data analysis project focusing on smart watch data utilizing Python for data extraction, cleaning, and visualization. Data was sourced from Excel files and processed using pandas for cleaning and preprocessing tasks. The project involved leveraging matplotlib.pyplot and plotly  libraries to create various charts and visual representations of smart watch data insights. Additionally, a comprehensive dashboard was developed using Power BI to present interactive visualizations and key findings from the analysis.
Key Activities:
Extracted smart watch data from Excel files into pandas dataframes for detailed analysis.
Applied data cleaning techniques within pandas to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
Utilized matplotlib and matplotlib.express to generate insightful charts (e.g., time series plots, activity distributions) for visualizing smart watch data patterns.
Developed a user-friendly dashboard using Power BI, integrating multiple visualizations and interactive elements to showcase data insights effectively.
